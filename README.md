# Blockbuster

This is an app that shows you the most popular movies from TheMovieDatabaseApi.
I am a nostalgic person so I've decided to make a tribute to Blockbuster, the movie rental chain.

I have not implemented pagination yet, so at the moment, you will only be able to fetch the first page.

MVVM pattern and Clean Architecture is used for this project.

Retrofit and Moshi are used to communicate with TheMovieDatabaseApi.

Glide library is used to load Images, and ListAdaptes is used as RecyclerView.
