# Blockbuster

This is an app that shows you the most popular movies from TheMovieDatabaseApi.
I am a nostalgic person so I've decided to make a tribute to Blockbuster, the movie rental chain.


MVVM and Clean Architecture are used for this project.

Retrofit and Gson are used to communicate with TheMovieDatabaseApi.

Glide library is used to load Images, and  Dependencies were injected with HILT-Dagger
